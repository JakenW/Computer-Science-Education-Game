Repository storing files for a computer science education game. The game will consist of 5 levels, or days, which include the user playing as a computer science instructor who will navigate around a school environment and interact with students. The interactions with students requires the user to solve a logical puzzle while also answering correctly to computer science related questions. When a level has been successfully completed, the user will be presented with a computer science lecture about a relevant topic. The project will be implemented using the development stack listed below.

Development stack: Flask (Backend), Python (Backend), SQLite3 (Backend), HTML (Frontend), CSS (Frontend), JavaScript (Frontend)
